# A Simple Framework for Constrastive Learning

## Exploring SimCLR Self-Supervised Learning for image classification

This project is an example built experimenting on the SimCLR Architecture with the objective of understanding the benefits of Self-Supervised Learning for Computer Vision. In this project, the following items are covered:
* Setting up a Pytorch environment that supports SimCLR
* Generating a custom Pytorch Dataset class
* Script examples to train and evaluate the DINO model
